# Welcome to My Square
***

## Task
The objective of this project is to create a program that generates a square (or rectangle) based on the specified width and height.
The program should dynamically handle inputs, print the pattern correctly, and return the appropriate results, even when unexpected inputs are provided.

## Description
This program reads two arguments from the command line: width and height. Using nested loops, it prints a rectangular pattern with:

    - Corners represented by o.
    - Horizontal edges represented by -.
    - Vertical edges represented by |.
    - The interior left blank (spaces).

If the input is invalid (e.g., fewer or more than 2 arguments are provided), the program exits.

## Installation
No installation is required. Compile the program using gcc or any other C compiler.
For example: gcc -o my_square my_square.c

## Usage
To run the program, use the following syntax: ./my_square <width> <height>

Example:

--INPUT--
./my_square 5 4

--OUTPUT--
o---o
|   |
|   |
o---o


```
./my_project argument1 argument2
```
