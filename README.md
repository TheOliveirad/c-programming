# C Programming Projects 💻

This repository contains foundational C programming projects completed during my Qwasar training and personal practice. Each folder is a standalone project demonstrating core programming concepts like logic, parsing, file handling, user input, and modular code structure.

## 🗂️ Projects

### 🔧 [`my_printf`](./my_printf/)
Reimplementation of the C `printf()` function using variadic arguments and manual format parsing.

### 📊 [`my_ngram`](./my_ngram/)
Character frequency counter that processes command-line input and outputs sorted frequency data.

### 🎮 [`my_mastermind`](./my_mastermind/)
Terminal-based clone of the Mastermind game. Accepts input round-by-round and gives feedback on well-placed and misplaced digits.

### 🧱 [`my_square`](./my_square/)
ASCII-art rectangle drawer using width and height input from the CLI. Handles corner cases like 1×1 and single-line output.
